      <h1>The Studio.</h1>
      <p>
        We are a web design studio based in Paris, France. Passionate about
        design and technology.
      </p>
      <h1>Each project is unique</h1>
      <p>
        We do not propose a ready-made solution or work methodology. We are
        convinced that each trade contributes and shapes the strategy to be
        implemented, we adapt to meet your specific needs. We offer wide ranging
        skills worked in a complementary way, allowing a coherence and a total
        optimization of the solution implemented.
      </p>
      <h1>The client is part of the team</h1>
      <p>
        We work WITH our customers, FOR their users. Together, we create brands
        and experiences that connect them with their targets.
      </p>
      <h1>No bullshit</h1>
      <p>
        We believe that transparency with our customers is an added value for
        them and for us. No hidden costs, no screwed-up subcontracting or
        untenable promises. From the quotation to the list of partners,
        planning, internal and external costs, etc. â€“ we are 100% transparent.
